#summary CDATA overview

== Introduction ==

Cdata is a web database development platform for clinical collaborative project.
Clinical setting is a peculiar and complex environment. 
Common problems: 
  * unclear and ever changing data structure and application requirements
  * complex and rich data structure
  * health professionals are far from being "power users" 
Cdata has been modeled thinking of paper-based office management workflow, with folders and "documents" that can be linked and combined together at will. The application has a pre-defined set of "information objects" or modules that can be connected together in a tree-like structure. For example, under a patient form I can create a diagnosis form, and under it a folder with files, discussion forum, Besides, data form structure can be changed through a web interface without changing the relational database model.
